So what exactly is this?

Well... I read my 5 year old son The Hobbit, and ever since he's been absolutely obsessed with all things dwarf.

It seemed like a fun school holiday project to make a little Python script for him which build a mine automatically. And then things grew from there! He showed so much interest in the first version (basically just an ascii character which cleared colored blocks from the screen) that I started getting him to write the logic for the simulation. So he writes the rules, I code it up.

Rules he's written are things like:

### Wizard rules:

1. A wizard is green
2. If a wizard sees a miner, he puts a spell on him
3. The spell makes the miner a saboteur (yep, he also loves https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9220/saboteur). 
4. After a bit of time the spell wears off

### Lava rules:

1. Lava starts at the bottom
2. If lava touches a creature, it dies
3. If there's space next to lava, it flows into it
4. Lava cools time and becomes rock


## FAQ

1. Don't you know about Dwarf Fortress?

Yes. Yes I do. I think you've totally missed the point here.
